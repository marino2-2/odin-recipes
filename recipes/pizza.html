    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
        <li><h3>Prepare the pizza dough</h3></li>
            <ol>
                <li>In a small bowl, combine the warm water, sugar, and yeast. Let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it becomes frothy.</li>
                <li>In a large mixing bowl, combine the flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil. Mix until the dough starts to come together.</li>
                <li>Transfer the dough to a floured surface and knead for about 5-7 minutes or until it becomes smooth and elastic. Place the dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover it with a damp cloth, and let it rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours or until it doubles in size.</li>
            </ol>
        <li><h3>Prepare the pizza sauce</h3></li>
            <ol>
                <li>In a saucepan over medium heat, combine the crushed tomatoes, minced garlic, oregano, basil, salt, and pepper.</li>
                <li>Simmer the sauce for 15-20 minutes, stirring occasionally, until it thickens. Adjust the seasoning to taste.</li>
            </ol>
        <li><h3>Preheat the oven</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Preheat your oven to the highest temperature it can go (usually around 475°F/245°C). If you have a pizza stone, place it in the oven while it preheats.</li>
            </ul>
        <li><h3>Roll out the dough</h3></li>
            <ul>
                <li>Punch down the risen dough and transfer it to a floured surface. Roll it out into your desired pizza shape and thickness.</li> 
            </ul>
        <li><h3>Assemble the pizza</h3></li>
            <ol>
                <li>If you have a pizza peel, transfer the rolled-out dough onto it. If not, use parchment paper on a baking sheet.</li>
                <li>Spread a thin layer of the pizza sauce over the dough, leaving a small border around the edges.</li>
                <li>Arrange the sliced mozzarella on top of the sauce. Add fresh basil leaves.</li>
            </ol>
        <li><h3>Bake the pizza</h3></li>
            <ol>
                <li>If you're using a pizza stone, carefully transfer the pizza from the peel to the hot stone in the oven. If using a baking sheet, place it directly in the oven.</li>    
                <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbly and slightly browned.</li>
            </ol>
        <li><h3>Finish and serve</h3></li>
            <ol>
                <li>Remove the pizza from the oven and drizzle with extra virgin olive oil.</li>    
                <li>Let it cool for a few minutes before slicing. Serve and enjoy your homemade Margherita pizza!</li>
